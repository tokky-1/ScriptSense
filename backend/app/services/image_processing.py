        2. Find contours (closed shapes) in the edge map
        3. Look for the largest 4-sided contour — that's likely the document

    Load and pre-process a document photo to produce a clean, binarized image

    WHY PRE-PROCESS?
    Raw photos have uneven lighting, perspective distortion, and colour noise.
    OCR models work much better on clean, high-contrast black-and-white images.

    Steps applied:
        1. Load with EXIF rotation correction
        2. Perspective correction (un-skew the document)
        3. Convert to grayscale
        4. Normalize uneven lighting (e.g. shadows from phone flash)
        5. Adaptive binarization (convert to pure black and white)
        6. Morphological cleanup (remove small noise specks)

    Args:
